         <h1 id="mainHeading">Picture Rocks in Michigan</h1> 
         <p id="testP">Unique to our area and by far our largest summer attraction is the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. The name “Pictured Rocks” comes from the streaks of mineral stain that can be seen on the face of the weathered-sculpted cliffs. An array of colors occur when groundwater seeps through the cracks and trickles down the rock face. Iron (red and orange), copper (blue and  green), manganese (brown and black), limonite (white) are among the most common color-producing minerals.</p>     
         <p class="funParagraph">Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore is managed by the National Park Service as one of only four National Lakeshores. 
            The Pictured Rocks tower 50 to 200 feet directly from Lake Superior and stretch for about fifteen miles along its 42-mile length.
          We had an amazing time there, it was so fun!</p>

It is located in Lake Huron, at the eastern end of the Straits of Mackinac, between the state's Upper and Lower Peninsulas. It has so many fun things to do. You should visit it too.</p>
